# Project 3: Spots
Seamus Ryan
### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is showing different images of spots of places and objects in areas. I had to make different modals to open different pieces of the project which leads to transition to next stage of the project. I used javascript as well as css to take from html to improve my project. I had to make changes to the cards to match the figma that way everything looked perfect to what the experts want to see.
**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
